# DeepLearning_irisdataset_beginnner
This repository contains a simple sequential model which I have used for the classification problem for the Iris_dataset. CSV file is also inculded. This repository should be used as a guide/tutorial to train an introductory deep learning project.
Iris_dataset was downloaded from the kaggle, but the original source is UCI Machine learning repository:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php.
Although, this classification problem can be solved using any general classification algorithm, because the dataset is small and simple. But here, we will use neural network to train this model.
